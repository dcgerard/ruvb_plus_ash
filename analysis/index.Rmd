## Simulations

* [RUVB Plus ASH Analysis](ruvb_plus_ash.html): I ran all the confounder adjustment methods when the true $\pi0$ is 0.9. Signal was added by poisson thinning. I then ran either ASH or qvalue on the resulting estimated effect sizes and their corresponding standard errors. Except for MOUTHWASH and BACKWASH, RUVB does the best.
* [Look at Calibration of LFDR/LFSR's](ruvb_lfsr.html) MOUTHWASH is awesome. RUVB + ASH is awesome. RUVB by itself is not so awesome.
* [Consistancy between seqgendiff and datamaker.R](compare_dg_seqgendiff.html)
* [Recapitulate AUC plots from paper using the output from seqgendiff.](initial_pvalue_eda.html)
* [Explore average FDR control of various methods](fdr_control.html)
* [Explore variability of FDR control of various methods](fdp_variability.html)
* [Explore variability in coverage results](coverage_variance.html). Don't see anything different here from what I have been seeing. Though it might be a little more clear.
* [When simulating under the assumed model, MOUTHWASH usually returns variance inflation factors less than 1.](vicar_t.html)
* [CATE does not adjust for df. This makes its variances very small for small sample sizes](var_code.html). Here, I also show equivalence between vicar's functions and cate and RUV4's functions.
* [Limma is scale-equivariant, recalculate limma-shrunk variances in RUV4 using three different approaches](limma_shrink.html)
