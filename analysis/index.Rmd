## Simulations

* [RUVB Plus ASH Analysis](ruvb_plus_ash.html): I ran all the confounder adjustment methods when the true $\pi0$ is 0.9. Signal was added by poisson thinning. I then ran either ASH or qvalue on the resulting estimated effect sizes and their corresponding standard errors. Except for MOUTHWASH and BACKWASH, RUVB does the best.
* [Look at Calibration of LFDR/LFSR's](ruvb_lfsr.html) MOUTHWASH is awesome. RUVB + ASH is awesome. RUVB by itself is not so awesome.
* [Consistancy between seqgendiff and datamaker.R](compare_dg_seqgendiff.html)
* [Recapitulate AUC plots from paper using the output from seqgendiff.](initial_pvalue_eda.html)
* [Explore average FDR control of various methods](fdr_control.html)
* [Explore variability of FDR control of various methods](fdp_variability.html)
